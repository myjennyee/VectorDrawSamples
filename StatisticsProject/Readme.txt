Description:

In this example is demonstrated how someone can use VectorDraw in order to present statistical information using charts. How, by using simple vdObjects,
more complex shapes and charts can be created. How to convert 2D objects to 3D or combine 2D objects to make 3D shapes. In more detail, this example demonstrates
the use of the vdPolyLine, the vdGroundSurface, the vdPolyFace, among others and how they can be used to create 3D displays. Furthermore is demonstrated
how to insert and modify images into a Vector Draw control. Everything mentioned above, are used in order to create 2D and 3D Graphic Charts and geometrical shapes.

Use:

While running the example, you'll notice a Tabbed panel. Every panel is titled after a specific chart. When selecting a Tab, the described chart is drawn in
the VectorDraw BaseControl. The values of the Chart are being extracted from the DataGrid on the right of the Panel. When selecting a tab, default values are
inserted in the DataGrid, but if desired, the DataGrid values can be changed. By pressing the "Redraw Chart" Button, a new Chart will be drawn using the new
values. Finally, there is the "3D Chart" CheckBox that, as its name states, when checked the Chart drawn is in 3D.
